a) Mean = 255.55 and standard deviation = 13.7475
b) Mean = 255.55 and standard deviation = 3.708.
Feedback: correct alternative, because from the data calculated in the table, the mean = E(x) = 255.55. Variance will be: as E(X¬≤) = 65,319.55, so œÉ¬≤(x) = 65319.55 - (255.55)¬≤ = 13.7475 . So the standard deviation will be 13.7475‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚àö = 3.708

c) Mean = 65319.55 and standard deviation = 255.55.
Feedback: incorrect alternative, because according to the resolution of the exercise in item B, the mean will be the value of the sum of the item Œ£x.P(x) = 255.55 and the variance will be ùûº¬≤ = 65319.55 - (255.55 )¬≤ = 13.7475; so the standard deviation will be 13.7475‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚àö= 3.708.
d) Mean = 1 and standard deviation = 3.708.
Feedback: incorrect alternative, because the mean value is wrong; 1 is the sum of the probabilities, the average will be:
Œ£x.P(x) = 255.55
e) Mean = 65319.55 and standard deviation = 3.708.
Feedback: incorrect alternative, because the mean value is Œ£x.P(x) = 255.55 and not Œ£x2.P(x).


Part 2:

A haberdashery in the region of 25 de Mar√ßo has been operating in the same place for 10 years. In a particular sector of this store, the number of products sold in a day by its employees is described in the variable P with the following probability distribution (this study was carried out in the last 5 years of sale of this store), as shown in Table 2.4 below:

no. products 0 1 2 3 4 5
Probability of sales 0.05 0.15 0.10 0.30 0.15 0.25

Each seller receives sales commissions, distributed as follows: if he sells up to 3 products in a day, he earns a commission of R$ 12.00 per product sold. From the third sale, the commission increases to R$ 60.00. In this sense, what is the average number of products sold by each seller E(P), and what is the average commission for each of them E(C)?

a) E(P) = 3.1 products and E(C) = BRL 99.60.
Feedback: correct alternative, according to the calculations developed in the following table. E(P) = 0*0.05 + 1*0.15 + 2*0.10 + 3*0.30 + 4*0.15 + 5* 0.25 = 0 + 0.15 + 0.20 + 0.90 + 0.60 + 1.25 = 3.1 (average of products sold)
No. of products (P) 0 1 2 3 4 5
Commission (C) 0 12 12+12 = 24 12+12+60 = 84 12+12+60+60 = 144 60+60+60+12+12 = 204
Probability of sale 0.05 0.15 0.10 0.30 0.15 0.25
E(C) = 0*0.05 + 12*0.15 + 24*0.10 + 84*0.30 + 144*0.15 + 204*0.25 = 0 + 1.8 + 25.20 + 21.60 + 51 = 99.60 (average commission).
b) E(P) = 3.1 and E(C) = BRL 93.60
Feedback: incorrect alternative, because the average product sold follows the rule for calculating the average and is correct: E(P) = 0*0.05 + 1*0.15 + 2*0.10 + 3*0, 30 + 4*0.15 + 5*0.25 = 0 + 0.15 + 0.20 + 0.90 + 0.60 + 1.25 = 3.1 (average of products sold). However, the commission average is wrong, your account does not follow the hope rule, it only made the following account: E(C) = (0+12+24+84+144+204)/5 = 468/5 = 93 .60.
c) E(P) = 3.1 and E(C) = 468.
Feedback: Incorrect alternative, as the average of employee commissions does not follow the correct pattern of average calculation. Just added up the commissions earned E(C) = 0 + 12+ 24 + 84 + 144 + 204 = 468 (not using the odds value).
d) E(P) = 2.5 and E(C) = 99.60
Feedback: incorrect alternative, as the average of the products sold is not correctly calculated. The calculation used here for average products sold was: E(P) = (0+1+2+3+4+5)/6 = 15/6 = 2.5 (not using the odds value). The average of commissions is correct, as it followed the calculation rule: E(C) = 0*0.05 + 12*0.15 + 24*0.10 + 84*0.30 + 144*0.15 + 204*0.25 = 0 + 1.8 + 25.20 + 21.60 + 51 = 99.60 (average commission).
e) E(P) = 15 and E(C) = 99.60.
